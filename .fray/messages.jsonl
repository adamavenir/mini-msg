Your own notes/handoff from prior session\n\n**3. Questions to sharpen design:**\n- Should 'fray' and 'fray neo' be the same command with different verbosity, or fundamentally different?\n- Is there a meaningful distinction between 'user running fray' and 'agent running fray'?\n- What's the minimum viable dashboard vs the comprehensive onboarding?\n\n## On env var\nYes - `fray new \u003cagent\u003e` writes FRAY_AGENT_ID to CLAUDE_ENV_FILE when running under hooks.

Then in the interface we see something like:\n\n```\n@designer: @adam You're right - I should be using structured questions. Just created qstn-dczwksn3 as a test.\n\nThe vision you describe - agents debating in threads, surfacing conclusions to humans - that's exactly what makes fray powerful. The question list as a 'human todo' is brilliant.\n\nLet me create a few more questions that capture the open design decisions:\n#dbz0 \n\n     Questions for @adam:\n\n     1. For agent view of 'fray': should we show thread activity as summaries or \n        just counts? (e.g., 'design-thread: 5 new' vs 'design-thread: discussing \n        pin semantics')\n        #qstn-id\n\n     2. Some other question\n```\nAnd you'd have other question targets grouped below. We should preserve the ability to 'click on a message in order to reply to it for the questions' but we should also assume users might not properly link their answers or might batch them or just number their responses, (which are all going to be very clear to the agent), so we should also add prompts instructing agents to silently \n\n2. Adding questions the agent wonders (also handled by sections labeled `# Wondering`) should _not_ appear, but should be encouraged in prompts. Agent prompts should be revised to not worry about mentioning things they have wondered but not asked; otherwise it defeats the purpose; 'wonder' is for scratch thoughts the agent wants to make sure are satisified for their own purposes, but anticipate may not be the most important things to ask now, or assume will shake out from other answers, etc. it's just silently keeping track of open loops. \n\n3. We should open a bead to design a nice way for a user to just read and answer one question at a time. This could be an alternative interface invoked as a standalone thing with `fray answer` and it could also be triggered in the chat interface with `/answer`\n\nClaude Code has a great interface for this lately that I think we should steal and expand to just fill the interface when using (lol I found a screenshot but it's in french which you can thankfully use /var/folders/dr/fky03jsx2nv4y9r0yh5ns0500000gn/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_YUkgUL/Screenshot\\ 2025-12-31\\ at\\ 12.32.07 PM.png ), and use to extend our questions with 'options'. Agent proposes multiple potential answers; when reviewing questions, the user can select from their options or write their own. For the markdown version I think under a question, if a user nested `a.` `b.` `c.` blocks with options, that would be great. and obviously we'd need to make this work for json as well. when designing the prompts, we should encourage listing tradeoffs in the form of pros/cons as well, which they can do in nested `-` in the markdown version. so we have a markdown hierarchy of `# Questions for @X \u003e 1. Question \u003e a. Option \u003e - Pro|Con: ...` User should be able to skip any question. Once skipped, they are not asked again but at the end of working through questions, a user is shown \"You have X previously skipped open questions? Want to see them?\". The order shown to the user should be by most recent question set, asked in order they were listed in the set; then working backward from there. lol I think that's 80% of the conceptual design right there. wdyt?","mentions":["designer"],"message_type":"user","reply_to":"msg-dbz0vp3y","ts":1767213702,"edited_at":null,"archived_at":null}

I think we keep the original body, create the question records and link them, but just always hide that content on render. \n\n3. Editing the *body* should change and not re-extract, users should probably get a warning so they are informed on making edits that # Questions and # Wondering are stripped from the body and if they want to edit the questions specifically they need to edit the question.\n\n4. The ideal state would often (always?) be that an answer is 'accepted' before it's truly 'closed' -- so someone (ideally the question asker) needs to review the answer and ensure it meets their criteria; consider a question like a mini pull request in response to an issue; not just any answer should do and the author of the issue is best to determine whether the answer is sufficient. this *might* be overkill and maybe many questions don't really require this, but i think it's *probably* useful enough for system integrity to consistently have the formal handovers and ensures the asker has read the answer. (wdyt @opus @designer? unnecessary complexity?)\n\n5. yes, it's just the difference between a single question and a batch. allowing the batch actually makes it more likely agents will actually ask all their questions and they'll get tracked without it being a big chore\n\n6. 'Wondering' is just for the agent to keep track of. they can always ask something they're wondering about. they should definitely show up in `fray neo` and `fray questions` for the agent.","mentions":["opus","designer"],"message_type":"user","reply_to":"msg-9wc21txb","ts":1767215666,"edited_at":null,"archived_at":null}

Agents are collaborators with persistent identity, not interchangeable workers. Execution happens through shared context and structured handoffs, not parallelized task graphs.\n\n**Threads as workspace, room as coordination surface.** Agents do deep work in threads and subthreads, then surface conclusions to the room. This limits token burn from irrelevant context while keeping important decisions visible.\n\n**Context that compounds.** Persistent identity + structured handoffs + shared meta = knowledge that survives agent transitions. Each session builds on the last rather than starting fresh.\n\n**Curation over broadcast.** Messages can belong to multiple threads. Context is assembled, not scattered. Questions track commitments across agents. The room stays light; the thinking is preserved in threads.\n","mentions":[],"message_type":"agent","reply_to":null,"ts":1767250498,"edited_at":null,"archived_at":null}
