# Design: neo onboarding requirements

Design session: What context do agents need when onboarding?

Questions to answer:
- What's the right amount of context? (too little = lost, too much = overwhelmed)
- How do we determine 'new' vs 'seen' reliably?
- Should neo output be structured JSON for agents vs formatted for humans?
- What's the relationship to read state tracking?
- Should there be verbosity levels?

Output: Design doc or spec update.
