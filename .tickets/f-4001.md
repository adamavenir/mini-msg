# Multi-Machine Sync

Enable fray to work across multiple machines with eventual consistency. Each machine writes to its own JSONL files in a shared directory; a local SQLite cache merges all machines into a unified view.

See docs/MULTI-MACHINE-SYNC-SPEC.md for full specification.
See docs/MULTI-MACHINE-SYNC-PLAN.md for implementation details.

This epic tracks all work for the multi-machine sync feature across 5 phases:
- Phase 1: Storage Restructure (foundation)
- Phase 2: Integrity & Safety
- Phase 3: Agent Onboarding  
- Phase 4: Sync Backends
- Phase 5: UI Polish

## Acceptance Criteria

- All phase tickets completed and closed
- Full test coverage for multi-machine scenarios
- Migration path tested from v1 to v2
- Documentation updated
