# Phase 2: Split thread curation commands

Split internal/command/thread_curation.go by command family.

Suggested file layout:
- internal/command/thread_anchor_cmd.go: NewThreadAnchorCmd + anchor helpers.
- internal/command/thread_pin_cmd.go: NewPinCmd/NewUnpinCmd.
- internal/command/thread_move_cmd.go: NewMvCmd + runThreadReparent.
- internal/command/thread_mute_cmd.go: NewThreadPin/Unpin/Mute/Unmute cmds.
- internal/command/thread_curation_helpers.go: getAllReplies/getAllRepliesWithGuard + shared helpers.

Preserve CLI behavior and JSON/console output.

## Acceptance Criteria

thread_curation.go split into focused files with no behavior changes. go test ./internal/command passes. Commit with message like 'refactor(command): split thread curation commands'.
