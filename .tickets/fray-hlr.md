# Add SessionStart resume tickler

On SessionStart (resume), add 3-bullet tickler with key principles:
- Claim files before editing
- Close beads when done
- Check fray @<agent> for mentions

Keep it terse to avoid noise. Could rotate/vary bullets to prevent habituation.

Files: internal/command/hook_session.go
