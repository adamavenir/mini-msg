# Split hosted sync service into separate repo

Create a new fray-hosted repository containing the hosted sync API + web UI (per docs/HOSTED-SYNC-PLAN.md). Keep CLI as client-only. Define repo structure (cmd/hosted-api, internal/, web/), shared protocol package, and migration steps for deployment + billing.
