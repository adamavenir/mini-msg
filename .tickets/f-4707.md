# HMAC/Signature Support for Multi-Machine Sync

Add cryptographic signatures to JSONL events for tamper detection. Recommended approach: use AAP per-agent Ed25519 signatures for non-repudiation (proving WHO wrote something) rather than channel-scoped HMAC. When implemented, invalid signatures should be skipped with warning during rebuild (don't fail entirely).
