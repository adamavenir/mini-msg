# Phase 7: Split hook safety module

Split internal/command/hooks/hook_safety.go into focused files.

Suggested file layout:
- internal/command/hooks/hook_safety_cmd.go: NewHookSafetyCmd/NewHookUninstallCmd + flag wiring.
- internal/command/hooks/hook_safety_install.go: installSafetyHooks + helpers.
- internal/command/hooks/hook_safety_uninstall.go: uninstallSafetyHooks/uninstallIntegrationHooks/uninstallPrecommitHook.
- internal/command/hooks/hook_safety_guard.go: safetyGuardScript const + guard helpers.
- internal/command/hooks/hook_safety_settings.go: hookSettings types + JSON merge utilities.

Keep CLI behavior and output unchanged.

## Acceptance Criteria

hook_safety.go split into focused files; behavior unchanged. go test ./internal/command passes. Commit with message like 'refactor(command): split hook safety module'.
