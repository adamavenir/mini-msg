# Test prep: jsonl_append write coverage

Add tests that validate JSONL append outputs for key entities.

Plan
- For each Append* function family, write to temp project and read back the JSONL line.
- Assert type field, required fields, and target file path.
- Include append helpers for messages, threads, agents, questions, reactions, roles, permissions, wake, jobs.
- Validate shared/runtime path behavior where applicable.

Keep tests independent of refactor.

## Acceptance Criteria

New tests cover append outputs for each entity family.
Tests: go test ./internal/db/...
Commit: test(db): add jsonl_append coverage
