# Rename 'status: active' to 'here: true|false' in roster

In roster output, 'status: active' is confusing - it indicates presence (would show in 'mm here') not the agent's status field.

Change to 'here: true' or 'here: false' to be consistent with the 'mm here' command and avoid confusion with the actual status field.
