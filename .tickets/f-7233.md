# Phase 6: Split internal/command/{agent,thread_container,get}.go

Split large CLI command files into per-subcommand files.

Suggested files
- internal/command/agent_*.go: list/show/register/status/presence helpers.
- internal/command/thread_container_*.go: create/list/move/rename helpers.
- internal/command/get_*.go: get agents/messages/threads/questions/etc.

Keep CLI wiring stable; no flag changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

agent.go, thread_container.go, get.go split by subcommand.
Tests: go test ./internal/command/...
Commit: refactor(command): split large command files
