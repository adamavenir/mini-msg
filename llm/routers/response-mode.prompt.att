Body: @message.body

## Response Modes

- **deep-work**: The agent is being asked to do substantial work - implement something, fix a bug, create a feature, continue a prior task. Needs full context, prior session resume, /fly-style prompt.

- **weigh-in**: The agent is being asked for their opinion, to review something, or contribute to a discussion. Needs thread context and relevant history, but not full session resume.

- **quick-answer**: A simple, direct question that can be answered briefly. Minimal context needed - just the question and maybe immediate thread.

- **acknowledge**: FYI or CC - the agent doesn't need to respond, just be aware. Should not spawn a session.

## Your Task

Determine which mode fits best. Consider:
- Is this initiating new work or continuing prior work?
- Is this asking for an opinion vs asking to do something?
- How much context does the agent need to respond well?
- Would a brief answer suffice, or is deep engagement needed?
